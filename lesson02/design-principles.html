          <h2>Repetition</h2>
          <h3>Gym</h3>
          <h4><a href="https://www.goldsgym.com/"> Fitness </a> </h4>
          <img src="./images/repetition.jpg" alt="screenshot of fitness" width = 100%>
          <h2> The website effectively employs the design principle of repetition to enhance its branding and user experience. The consistent use of a black and gold color scheme, from the logo to the call-to-action button, creates a visually cohesive and striking effect. This is complemented by the uniform font style and weight in the headings and buttons, reinforcing the gym's message of strength and endurance. The theme of legacy is skillfully repeated in both the visual and textual elements, emphasizing the gym's long-standing history of facilitating fitness transformations. Overall, the repetition principle is utilized here to establish a memorable brand identity and a powerful user call to action.</h2>

          <h2>Contrast</h2>
          <h3>Tesla</h3>
          <h4><a href="https://www.tesla.com/"> Tesla </a> </h4>
          <img src="./images/contrast.jpg" alt="screenshot of tesla site" width = 100%>
          <h2> This mobile site demonstrates the principle of contrast effectively through its use of a dark background juxtaposed with the white text of the "Model 3" headline and the vivid red of the car, instantly drawing the eye. The bold, capitalized typography of the model name contrasts with the more subdued details, accentuating the product name and enticing users to engage with the call to action. These contrasting elements not only enhance visual appeal but also serve to clearly guide users' attention to the most important information and actions available on the page.

          <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2> 
          <h3>Shein</h3>
          <h4><a href="https://m.shein.com/us/"> Shein </a> </h4>
          <img src="./images/white space.jpg" alt="shein screenshot" width = 100%>
          <h2> This mobile website exemplifies white space and clean design principles by providing ample space around various elements, such as the "Free Shipping" and "Return Policy" sections, ensuring content is easily legible and not overwhelming. The layout adopts a minimalist style that clearly delineates between sections for collections, offers, and categories, facilitating a user-friendly navigation experience. Images and text are given enough room to stand out, promoting readability and aesthetic appeal. Overall, the design's strategic use of space and clean lines create an organized and inviting digital environment for shoppers.
